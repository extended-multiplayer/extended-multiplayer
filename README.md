## Extended Multiplayer
Emerging as a groundbreaking endeavor, Ex-Mp redefines the boundaries of multiplayer gaming by seamlessly connecting PC and mobile platforms within the legendary universe of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Built on the backbone of Rockstar Northâ€™s proven networking systems, this innovative project transforms a beloved single-player experience into a vibrant, interconnected multiplayer phenomenon.

## Contribute to the project
Why contribute to Ex-Mp? If you master C/C++ or other languages and share our passion for innovation and multiplayer games, your expertise will not only be welcome - it will be essential to shaping the future of this project.

### Clear Structure, Direct Impact:
Ex-Mp is being built with a modular architecture and detailed documentation, ensuring that every contributor, whether beginner or veteran, understands the logic of the code and can collaborate without barriers. Nothing will be left to chance: from network synchronization to cross-platform integration, every line of code will be organized to promote clarity and efficiency.

## Project objectives
### Universal performance:
Ensuring light and stable execution on all platforms (PC and mobile), prioritizing resource optimization, minimum memory consumption and compatibility with entry-level and mid-range devices.
### Radical Simplicity:
Replicating the accessibility of SA-MP, where you only need the original game to play, but raising the standard with:
  * Plug-and-play installation (no complex configurations).
  * Efficient network synchronization, even on low-bandwidth connections.
### Community as an Engine:
Building a collaborative ecosystem between developers, players and enthusiasts:
  * Open documentation and tutorials to facilitate technical contributions.
  * Active feedback channels (Discord, forums) to integrate players' ideas into the roadmap.
  * Reward system for contributors (recognition in the project, access to betas).
### Fluid and Inclusive Cross-Play:
Create a unified experience between PC and mobile, without technical drawbacks:
  * Adaptable controls (touchscreen + keyboard/mouse).
  * Balancing mechanics to avoid disparities between platforms (e.g. intelligent aim assist for mobile).
  * Responsive and resizable user interface (UI) for any screen.
